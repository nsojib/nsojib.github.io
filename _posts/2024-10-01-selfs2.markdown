We propose a Behavior Cloning for Error Detection (BED) framework that can detect incorrect human demonstrations in a self-supervised manner. With lay users demonstration we show that using our method robots can learn to avoid unsafe behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in RoboSuite simulation and with a Sawyer robot.
